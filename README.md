# With pytube you can't directly convert a youtube video to mp4 with audio, so you have to get the video, and audio separately. Then you have to combine them. I used FFmpeg to combine them. 
To use the converter you have to type in: python (the file which the code is in)  (the url link for the youtube video inside "") (and the  path of folder you want to put it in, in "") obs. I didn't include the folder I used called "Downloaded"
To combine using FFmpeg, first you have to download it; after that you need to put in: ffmpeg -i (the path to the mp4 in "") -i (the path to the mp3 in "") -c:v copy -c:a aac (here you can write what the combined filed will be called; output_combined.mp4 is just an example)
